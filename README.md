ReviewNinja is a lightweight code review tool that works with GitHub, providing
a more structured way to use pull requests for code review. ReviewNinja
dispenses with elaborate voting systems, and supports hassle-free committing
and merging for acceptable changes. Our primary focus is making it easier to
identify, review, collaborate and track problems with a specific pull request
until they're satisfactorily addressed.

ReviewNinja tries to store the least amount of information from your GitHub
account to make sure the data is up to date and the data is stored at GitHub
only.

ReviewNinja was built to integrate into GitHub.com as well as GitHub
Enterprise. The application stack includes Node.js, Express, MongoDB and
AngularJS.

Why should I use ReviewNinja?
------------------------------

ReviewNinja defines a clearer process for code review in GitHub. ReviewNinja
also provides a status overview, so team members in addition to development can
understand the state of the project (e.g., product management).
